			<h2>KVB Interactive Ltd Privacy Statement</h2>
			<h3>About this policy</h3>
			<p>At KVB Interactive, we understand and appreciate that you may be concerned about your privacy and about the confidentiality and security of information we may gain about you. We are committed to protecting your privacy and to complying with New Zealand Privacy Act 1993.</p>
			<p>Please read this statement to understand how your personal information is collected, used, protected and recorded by us.</p>
			<h3>Your acknowledgement of our Privacy Policy</h3>
			<p>The Privacy Policy is published on our website in order to meet our obligation under New Zealand Privacy Law which requires us to outline our policies on the management of personal information in a clearly expressed document which is available to anyone that asks for it.</p>
			<p>Without limiting the above statement, your use of this website constitutes an acknowledgement that you have been made aware of our privacy policies.</p>
			<h3>What is personal information?</h3>
			<p>“Personal Information” is defined in the Privacy Act 1993 (the Privacy Act), and means all information about an identifiable individual.</p>
			<p>The information that we seek to collect about you will depend on the products or services that we provide. If you do not allow us to collect all of the information we request, we may not be able to deliver all of those services effectively.</p>
			<h3>What kinds of personal information do we collect and hold?</h3>
			<p>“Personal Information” is defined in the Privacy Act 1993 (the Privacy Act), and means all information about an identifiable individual.</p>
			<p>The information that we seek to collect about you will depend on the products or services that we provide. If you do not allow us to collect all of the information we request, we may not be able to deliver all of those services effectively.</p>
			<h3>For what purposes do we collect, hold, use and disclose personal information?</h3>
			The main reason we collect, use, hold and disclose personal information is to provide you with products and services. This includes:
			<ul>
				<li>checking whether you are eligible for the product or service;</li>
				<li>providing the product or service; and</li>
				<li>helping manage the product or service.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We may also use your information to comply with legislative or regulatory requirements in any jurisdiction, prevent fraud, crime or other activity that may cause harm in relation to our products or services and to help us run our business. We may also use your information to tell you about products or services we think may interest you.</p>
			<h3>How do we collect personal information?</h3>
			<p>	We collect most personal information directly from you, unless you have authorised us to collect that information from another party. 
				For example, we will collect your personal information when you apply for or use a product or service or talk to us in person, on the phone or via other communication methods (e.g. email or facsimile). We may also collect your personal information through monitoring or recording conversations to protect you in your dealings with us and to provide a record in the event of a dispute about the transaction.
			</p>
			<p>We also collect information from you electronically. For instance, when you visit our website or whenever you apply for or access KVB products and services electronically (see “Do we collect personal information electronically?”).</p>
			Sometimes we collect personal information about you from other people or organisations. This may happen without your direct involvement. For instance, we may collect personal information about you from:
			<ul>
				<li>other KVB Group companies;</li>
				<li>publicly available sources of information, such as public registers;</li>
				<li>government agencies;</li>
				<li>your representatives (including your legal adviser, mortgage broker, financial adviser, executor, administrator, guardian, 		trustee, or attorney);</li>
				<li>other organisations, who jointly with us, provide products or services to you; and</li>
				<li>commercial information service providers, such as companies that provide credit ratings</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>How do we hold personal information?</h3>
			<p>Much of the information we hold about you will be stored electronically in secure data servers which are located in New Zealand and owned by KVB. Some information we hold about you will be stored in paper files. We use a range of physical and electronic security measures to protect the security of the personal information we hold.</p>
			<p>We maintain strict standards and procedures to prevent unauthorised access to your personal information and ensure correct use of information. Access to your account and account information is protected from unauthorised access through the use of secure passwords and user log-on and other security procedures. Only authorised users can access an individual’s personal information. Computer and network systems are protected using security measures including firewalls and encryption data.</p>
			<p>Any information not required to be kept by law or necessary to conduct your business with us is destroyed using secure methods.</p>
			<p>While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure the security of any information that you transmit to us over the Internet and you do so at your own risk. However, once we receive your transmission, we take all reasonable steps to ensure that your information is secure on our systems and those of our agents.</p>
			<h3>Who do we disclose your personal information to, and why?</h3>
			Generally, we use or disclose personal information collected about you for:
			<ul>
				<li>the primary purpose for which the information is collected (that is, providing products or services to you);</li>
				<li>a purpose which is related to the products or services we provide to you and which you would reasonably expect us to use the 		information for (for example, updating our records, contacting you or for statistical purposes)</li>
				<li>a purpose required, authorised or permitted by or under any law such as Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of 		Terrorism Act;</li>
				<li>our related companies; or</li>
				<li>a purpose made known to you and to which you have consented.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Do we disclose personal information overseas?</h3>
			We may disclose your personal information to a recipient which is located outside New Zealand. This includes:
			<ul>
				<li>KVB Group companies located in Sydney, Melbourne, Toronto, Hong Kong, Taipei and Beijing;</li>
				<li>KVB Group’s service providers which are likely to be located in Sydney, Melbourne, Toronto, Hong Kong, Taipei and Beijing;</li>
				<li>for international transactions, such as currency exchanges, we may need to disclose your information to the corresponding 		international party in order to process the transaction. The countries we disclose your information to will depend on the details of the transaction you ask us to carry out.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p>The personal information may be disclosed to the overseas receipt only when we reasonably believe that the overseas recipient of the information is subject to a law, or binding scheme, that has the effect of protecting the information in a way that, overall, is at least substantially similar to the way in which the New Zealand Privacy Act protect the information. <br> We may also disclose the personal information to overseas receipt if it is required or authorised by or under a New Zealand law or a court/tribunal order, or if it is a permitted general situation described in the Privacy Act.</p>
			<h3>Do we use or disclose personal information for marketing?</h3>
			<p>We will use your personal information to offer you products and services we believe may interest you. These products and services may be offered by a member of KVB Group or one of its preferred suppliers. We may offer you products and services by various means, including by mail, telephone, email, SMS or other electronic means, such as through social media or targeted advertising through KVB Group or non-KVB Group websites. <br> We will generally only do this with your consent and we will always provide a simple means for you to opt out of receiving such information in the future, or you can contact us directly.</p>
			<h3>Do we collect personal information electronically?</h3>
			<p>We will collect information from you electronically, for instance through online loan application form. Any information that you enter on to an online application form will only be collected by us if you submit your online application. In other words, if you cancel your application or log out prior to submitting your application, any information which you had entered is automatically deleted.</p>

				<li>Location information about users;</li>
